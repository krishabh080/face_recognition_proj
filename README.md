# Build Facial recognition with Python, OpenCV, OpenAI CLIP and pgvector

## Program Flow

This program follows a sequential flow to achieve facial recognition using Python, OpenCV, OpenAI CLIP, and pgvector. Below is the step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Download Images**
   - Download all target pictures into a local folder.

2. **Face Extraction**
   - Identify and extract faces from the downloaded pictures.

3. **Embedding Calculation**
   - Calculate facial embeddings from the extracted faces.

4. **Database Storage**
   - Store these facial embeddings efficiently in a PostgreSQL database using the pgvector data type.

5. **Colleague Identification**
   - Obtain a colleague's picture to use for identification purposes.

6. **Face Recognition**
   - Recognize the face within the provided colleague's picture.

7. **Identification Embeddings**
   - Calculate embeddings for the identified face within the provided picture.

8. **Similarity Matching**
   - Utilize the pgvector distance function to retrieve the closest matching faces and corresponding photos from the database.

By following these steps, you can build a powerful facial recognition system to match faces efficiently and accurately.
